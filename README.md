# chem-text-adventure
This is a choose your own adventure game, built by Carl, in an attempt to gamify the learning of chemistry.

Hopefully I was (at least somewhat) successful!

To play the game, download the Github repository and run index.html.

Or, you can view it live at https://bit.ly/chem-cyoa.

For those who aren't CS nerds:

1. Go to the [main page](https://github.com/OrigamiKoala/chem-text-adventure) for this repo and click on "Code" (the green button). Then, click "Download as Zip".
2. In your file manager, click on the zip and open it.
3. Then, run the index.html file. Please note that most modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc) have made their CORS rules stricter, which essentially means you can't open the html file in your browser. If you do, the game won't work properly. Either open the html file in a terminal, or in an older browser.

**Please note that this game is still being developed; new content is constantly being added.**

I will try to release new updates every Saturday, though the updates might only modify old content, instead of introducing new modules.

If you have any feedback (positive or otherwise), please feel free to fill out a feedback form (https://bit.ly/chemcyoafeedback).

Most of the code for this game was AI-generated (via Visual Studio Code's Github Copilot and Google Gemini). I did do quite a bit of editing (because AI is not that good at writing bug-free code yet...or at visual design...), but since some of the code is AI generated, I cannot claim credit for it, or put it under a license.

However, any text that appears in the game is 100% human-written by yours truly 😁

So the text is under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en) license, but the code is not.
