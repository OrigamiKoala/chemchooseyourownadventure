List of commands:
<br> 'help' - open up the help manual (this one)
<br> 'outline' - open up the outline (can jump to different sections)
<br> 'undo' - undo previous response (you can't undo more than that)
<br>
<br>You can skip the typing animation by hitting the enter key.
<br>To restart the game, just reload the page or relaunch the HTML file. Your progress will not be saved; you can jump to the section you were on by typing 'outline'
<br>
<br>Please note that links only load after the typing animation has finished.

<br>How to format answers:
<br>Unless specified, round all answers to the appropriate significant figures. Unsure what that means? Check out http://www.astro.yale.edu/astro120/SigFig.pdf.
<br>If you are typing a word/phrase, make sure everything is lowercase. If you are typing a long response, you do not need to worry about that.
<br>If you are responding to question with multiple options, make sure to type the number of your answer, not the answer itself. For example, if the question options are '1. banana, 2. apple, 3. orange' and you want to answer 'banana', type '1'
<br>
<br>You can continue the game below by typing your response to the previous question.
