For example, if the options are '1. banana, 2. apple, 3. orange' and you would like to answer 'banana', type '1'.\n\nIf you are asked to respond with a word/phrase, make sure it is lowercase and spelled correctly. If you are typing a long response, capitalize as you please.\n\nIf at any point you wish to see a list of commands or how to format your answer, type 'help'.\n\nTyping 'outline' will generate an outline of content; you can skip to the section you wish.\n\nIf you wish to take back your answer, type 'undo'. Note that this works only for the previous answer; you cannot undo more than that (as of right now).\n\nThe game will display previous prompts for your reference. If you wish to print it out, just hit Ctrl+P or Cmd+P (for Mac).\n\nType anything to start from the beginning.",

He decided at some point, you would reach the smallest thing in the universe that couldn't be split further. He called this atomos, meaning \"indivisible\". Later, scientists would call these super small particles \"atoms\".\n\nBut these were ancient Greeks, and they didn't yet have the tools to do fancy experiments to figure out the truth. So they kind of just forgot about atoms and agreed that all of matter was made of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water (hence Avatar). What's your favorite element?\n\n1) Earth\n2) Air\n3) Fire\n4) Water",

Three of their most famous goals were to make a panacea (something that could cure all diseases), find or make an elixir of immortality (that could ensure they lived forever), and turn any metal into gold (for more info see here). \n\nHistory kind of portrayed alchemists as superstitious crackpots who had no idea what they were doing, and were super greedy.\n\nI don't know how accurate that is, given that Isaac Newton (the guy who introduced the idea of gravity) was also an alchemist...\n\nBut the alchemists did something very important... they wrote down what they did!\n\nIn fact, they wrote down a lot of stuff",
