[{"id":0,"text":"Welcome to a choose-your-own-adventure game made by Carl, where you get to have fun (hopefully) and also learn some chemistry along the way (also hopefully)!<br><br>This game is interactive; type your response in the box below and hit enter.<br><br>Sometimes, you will be asked a question with multiple choices given; to respond, input the number next to your desired choice. For example, if the options are '1. banana, 2. apple, 3. orange' and you would like to answer 'banana', type '1'.<br><br>If you are asked to respond with a word/phrase, make sure it is lowercase and spelled correctly. If you are typing a long response, capitalize as you please.<br><br>If you wish to skip the typing animation, hit the 'Enter' key again.<br><br>If at any point you wish to see a list of commands or how to format your answer, type 'help'.<br><br>Typing 'outline' will generate an outline of content; you can skip to the section you wish.<br><br>If you wish to take back your answer, type 'undo'. Note that this works only for the previous answer; you cannot undo more than that (as of right now).<br><br>The game will display previous prompts, for your reference. If you wish to print it out, just hit Ctrl+P or Cmd+P (for Mac).<br><br>Type anything to start from the beginning.","type":"fr","next":1},{"id":1,"text":"this is div 1, fr","type":"fr","next":2},{"id":2,"text":"this is div 2, frq, ans = hi","type":"frq","next":3,"correct":"hi"},{"id":3,"text":"this is div 3, mcq","type":"mcq","next":4,"op1":0,"op2":1,"op3":2,"op4":4},{"id":4,"text":"this is div 4, links to div 6","type":"fr","next":6},{"id":5,"text":"end","type":"fr"},{"id":6,"text":"this is div 6, links to div 5","type":"fr","next":5}]
